	 * rebuild this example without hardcoding lane changing logic using bezier
	 * curve. Test seemed fine using bezier curve to make curve(x y range wasn't
	 * leaving out the lane time taken to move straight lane + curve +make full
	 * circle+ leave lane seemed as it should be (approximately 43 second for
	 * 100 pixel in-and-out lane+ circle with 20 radius)

	 * WORK ON THIS AFTER MAKING CONNECTION POINT WORK
